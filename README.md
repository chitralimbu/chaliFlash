# chaliFlash
A card game you can play with AI or other players. 
The rules for chali flash or teen pati can be found here: https://www.pagat.com/vying/teen_patti.html

I think I have managed to code most of the rules down

Just something I did to pass the time. 

The AI works mostly using probability, The AI's probability to choose a certain move
e.g. to see, play or fold, depends on the amount of money they have, the moves of the
players before them or if theyve seen, based on the cards they have. 

Most of the probability is pretty simple, although the math may not be 100% accurate. 

A human player can also join and play the AI, its not the best AI in the world, so you
can easily bluff the AI. 

This is my first JAVA project in a while, Ive tried my best to OOP, but its not the most
efficient or effective pieces of code, but it works for the most part.
